# Recurring Meetups

Here is some information around what we look for in recurring meetups. The main pieces that we look for before starting a group are:

* Interest in the topic/space
* 2 Leads that can dedicate time to going every month (or at least relatively often)
* Hosts for the events

Getting all of these things in place takes some time. So as long as you are interested in the group and will be for a fair bit of time - reach out to us at <dc@womenwhocode.com> about where we stand regarding the group!  

Recurring language meetups can take many forms. One week might be a tech talk from a member of the group (e.g. a talk on Ruby fundamentals for Ruby on Rails). Another week could be a code along of a tutorial (e.g. following along together as you go through the Android _Building Your First App_ guide). A hack night is more free form where people could work on open source projects or personal development that they want to get done. There are many more ideas listed in our [Suggested Meeting Types](https://github.com/womenwhocodedc/organization/blob/master/leadership-resources/Education/suggested-meeting-types.md). This list isn't exhaustive so feel free to suggest topics as well.  

## Hack Night Ideas

* Language specific or agnostic
* Free for all to work on whatever projects / tools they desire
* Leader encourages 5-15 minute demos of projects and technologies
* Promote members working together to build an app/website/hack for X
* Less structured, “mentors” may float around if in attendance

## Language Lab Ideas

* Should have some sort of plan for the duration of the meetup, or meetups if planned to split over multiple sessions
	* coursera class
	* book to follow
	* tech talk
	* free online lectures (with problem sets)
	* Leader could create a lesson plan, but that would require more commitment and understanding of what they want to go over
* Have an leader that is dedicated to going through all of the materials
* Set a timeline for the group if split over multiple sessions (4 weeks Rails, 3 weeks of a Python project, etc.)
	* Members can join late or come in and out
	* Awesome opportunity for someone to document their work throughout the course so that if people come late they can use that as a resource!
	* At the start of a new group, it could be beneficial to schedule out everything that you will learn so people can follow along. And then after one round you will have a group of people that all know the materials and can help those that join later.
* Promote communication, collaboration, and camaraderie between group members
* Promote that group members attend larger DC tech events relevant to their work
	* Front end group goes to DC JS meetups, Java to DC Java, etc.    
* **Examples**
	* Follow the coursera course [Intro to Python](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython)
	* Go through the book [Cracking the Coding Interview (Java)](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X)
	* Do something awesome like what the NYC chapter did with the [Internet of Things](http://www.meetup.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/events/199804712/)
