# Requirements & Expectations for Education Team Leads

### Organizational Logistics
1. Uphold our [Code of Conduct]()
1. Attend regular meetups at least twice a month (not necessarily for the team you're a lead with)
1. Attend quarterly Education Team meetings in person or on the phone

### Meetup Logistics 
1. Those who attended the Meetup should follow up with at least two members on Slack in the following days
1. Those who didn't attend the Meetup should welcome new members to Slack by mentioning them by `@name`
1. Coordinate with other leads weekly to prepare for the next meetup
  - There should be a weekly conversation (eg. on Slack of Hangouts) initiated by the newest lead (supervised by the newest lead's mentor) to [ensure the upcoming meetups are instantiated effectively]().  talk before/after the study group weekly for 30 minutes or so
  - All leads will be given the ability to make Meetup.com events. These should be made **at least** two weeks in advance.
If you need help making an event, speak to your Mentor. If you don't have one or know who they are, talk to the [Education Team Manager]()

### Community Emphasis
- Cultivate and encourage conversation in the language channels and welcome newcomers to both #_general]() and your specific language channels
- Constantly consider diversity
  - Think about how to encourage diversity in eg. race, sexual orientation, age, socioeconomic status, language, marital/parental status, and religion
  - Where/when we meet, who you follow up with on Slack, and who you target for leadership & membership affects who will show up each week
  - DC is over 50% black and 10% of DC identifies as LGBTQ. 
**Are Women Who Code DC's demographics commensurate with our city's? Why not?**

### Empowerment Emphasis
One of our [goals as an organization]() is to increase the visibility of women in the tech scene in the region. One of the ways we work to accomplish this is to provide the platform for our women to speak! 
- We'd like for all of our leads to be evangelists about coding, making technical presentations, sharing their code, sharing their expertise in other fields (and at the intersections). 
1. Speaking!
  - Each of our members and our leads are a wealth of knowledge and are 100% capable of conveying it in awesome and interesting ways. 
  - We want to get everyone on stage if they consent to being put on one
1. Writing! 
  - Women Who Code (DC?) has been building up an internet presence by using Medium.com. We and our members can find some more visibility for ourselves and the organization by writing on Medium or our own websites. 
  - We as leads should all make it our goal to empower our members to share their expertise in writing
1. Git! 
  - Git is an awesome way to disperse information and make decisions collaboratively 
  - Git is the industry standard.
  - Every team lead should [be familiar with git]() and help others become familiar at every opportunity
