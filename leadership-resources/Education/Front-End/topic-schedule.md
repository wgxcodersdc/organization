Possible Ideas based on Slack talk: 

Mean Stack: Spend each evening focused on one part of the stack, starting from the bottom up. Finish on Angular.

Frameworks Series: Do a basic rundown of a popular framework once the MEAN stack stuff is done. We’ll focus only on the most popular frameworks and those that show interest among members.
