# How to make a Women Who Code DC Meetup Happen

### Before the Meetup
- The newest lead and her mentor (the person who recruited her) are responsible for the planning and creation of the Meetup.com event
  - This **does not imply she must personally create the Meetup.com event or even attend the meetup**
  - It _is_ the newest lead's responsibility to ask people to volunteer to create the Meetup.com event, commit to attending, etc.
  - This responsibility will remain with her until another newest lead is recruited
- Meetups should be **on Meetup.com** _at least two weeks before_ the event. Two weeks is about right for our hosts to feel comfortable that we wont stand them up & for people to make plans to attend but not forget
- Before a meetup is scheduled on Meetup.com, at least two team leads must commit to being there for the night
- Location logistics are to be dealth with through the [Network Manager]()

### Day-of Meetup Agenda

#### Demo / Tech Talk Time / Wrap Up (8:00-8:30pm)
- Try to schedule a demo / project share for 8pm.
- Go around once more and have everyone say:
  - Their name
  - What they accomplished at the meetup
    - Everyone accomplished something, but they usually don't realize it at first
    - Ask prodding or clarifying questions. Try to get them to quickly bestow their new knowledge to everyone else in the room. 
- Make sure they aren’t forgetting things

#### Directly Afterwards
- Check for forgotten items at the end

#### In the Following Days
- Follow up on Slack with at least two members.
  - Ask them about something they said they were working on
  - See if they need help
  - Send them another resource 
  - See if they might be interested in speaking at an event in the future!
** A simple hello a day or two after the meetup will have a HUGE effect on them coming back and being involved**
