# Becoming part of the Women and Gender eXpansive Coders DC Leadership Team

## Hi! You're probably at this page because either:
- a Women and Gender eXpansive Coders DC Lead sent you here
or 
- you're reading the WGXC DC Documentation just for fun
In either case, you're probably a good fit for the job!

Next steps in getting involved are:

### Definitely:
- Read through our [Leadership Roles and Responsibilities](), and particularly the [Leadership Expectations](https://github.com/wgxcodersdc/organization/blob/master/leadership-resources/leadership_overview.md#leadership-expectations) section to get an idea of what you're thinking of signing up for.
- If you're interested in leading a specific language group (including algorithms), attend a few meetups to get a feel for how they work
  - Introduce yourself to the current leads. Even if it seems like there are enough leads, they'll still be interested in hearing from you. While it may be possible in the future, we have yet to have too many leads for a group.
- If you're not in our Slack, [sign up](bit.ly/WGXCdcslack)

### Probably:
- Contact a director on Slack and say hi if you're not sure what you want to be involved with
  - _tip:_ If you want to be a language group lead but you don't know which group, attend a few of the ones you might be interested to check it out. Language leads know best how their groups work since they're closer to the day to day aspects of organizing them.
