## Presenting on Twitch

### Addressing participant questions
Outside specific Q&A sections, presenter should focus on the lab, not the comments from participants. To that end, it's recommended that presenter and moderator set up a channel of communication (e.g. texting) for critical feedback during the presentation.



## Moderating on Twitch

### Preparation
Presenter should communicate with moderator in advance about any links that might need to be shared with participants during the session.  It may also be valuable to discuss areas that will be "in scope" and "out of scope" for the presentation so that moderator can share resources / address participants' concerns appropriately.

### Code of Conduct Issues
It's recommended that the moderator set up automatic mod chats to remind people to be kind and to follow the CoC and that any attendees who violate the CoC risk getting blocked. Individuals who violate the CoC on chats should be blocked. Moreover, moderator can turn on mod settings in the Twitch chat in order to delete comments.
