The first step is to get you onto our Slack messaging group if you're not already. That's how all of the DC network leads and directors communicate, but also where our members connect with each other. If you're not on it, I can send an invite to whatever email address you prefer. The next step I would say is to take a look at some of our resources on GitHub (https://github.com/wgxcodersdc/organization/blob/master/leadership-resources/becoming_a_leader.md), particularly around leadership like that link I shared there, and get a feel of what kind of things you might be interested in helping out with. If you're not sure yet, the best way is probably to attend a few different kinds of events and see which resonates most with you. Once you think you know which area you want to focus on we can make sure that you're invited to all the right Slack channels and get in touch with the leads of that group.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Thanks!
