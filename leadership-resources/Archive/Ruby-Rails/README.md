### Responsibilities
- Education Team Leads are expected to attend regular meetups at least **twice** a month, unless your group meets only twice a month.
- Post Meetup Community Building
  - **the leads who attended the Meetup should each reach out to _two_ newer attendees to follow up about something**
  - **leads who didn't attend the Meetup should monitor Slack to welcome new members in the channel by `@name`**
- Post Meetup Logistics (a combination of:)
  - weekly call to go over the previous week and what is next
  - talk before/after the meetup weekly for 30 minutes or so
  - pick a time coordinate on Slack (#ruby-on-rails_leads) together
  - updating github with resources & links posted in relevant channels
- On slack you should be cultivating conversation in the [#ruby-on-rails]() channel and welcoming newcomers to [#general]() and [#ruby-on-rails]()
All committed leads will be given the ability to make Meetup.com events. These should be made **at least** two weeks in advance.
- If you need help making an event, speak to one of the other leads or ask in [#all-leads]() on Slack.

### Our General Goals as a Tech Meetup
One of our [goals as an organization]() is to increase the visibility of women in the tech scene in the region. One of the ways we work to accomplish this is to provide the platform for our women to speak! 
We'd like for all of our leads to be evangelists about
1. Speaking! Our members and our leads are a wealth of knowledge and are totally capable of conveying it in awesome ways. We can get everyone a stage if they consent to being put on one!
  - Many of our events should end with a 5 minute talk by one or several of the participants regarding what they learned, taught, or need to learn.
1. Writing! Women and Gender eXpansive Coders (DC?) has been building up an internet presence with Medium.com. We and our members can find some more visibility for ourselves and the organization by writing on Medium or our own websites. 
1. Git! Git is 1) an awesome way to disperse information and make decisions collaboratively and 2) is the industry standard. Every Ruby on Rails Lead should [be familiar with git]() and help others become familiar frequently

Constantly consider diversity. 
Think about how to encourage diversity in race, sexual orientation, age, socioeconomic, and religion.
Where we meet, who you follow up with on Slack, and who you target for membership affects who will show up each week
DC is uniquely positioned as over 50% of our city is black and 10% of DC identifies as LGBTQ. **Do the demographics of our beginners reflect this? Why not?**


### Day-of Meetup Agenda
#### Before (15 Minutes before listed meetup time)
* Make sure you have saved the host’s phone number
* At the front door: post signs (“Yes! Women and Gender eXpansive Coders is here!”) 15 minutes before start-time. 
* Include your phone number or otherwise make sure people can get in, as well as directions to the room / room number
* In the meetup room write: 
 * wifi password in unambiguous characters, 	
 * link to slack (bit.ly/join-slack-dc-WGXC)
 * WGXC Twitter handle (@wgxcodersdc)

#### During (6:30-8:00pm)
* Introduction (No shit, before 7PM!) :
 * Intro to WGXC + the specific meetup. Say the Mission Statement.
 * Mention wifi, WGXC slack, twitter, meetup format, active projects
 * Ideally people will communicate on Twitter and Slack during the meetup
 * Go around the room and everyone introduce themselves, and what they’re working on
 * Name, why you are here, what you want to learn, experience, where you work, fun fact
 * Keep attendance
 * Ask people to demo what they make at future meetups

#### Demo / Tech Talk Time! 8:00-8:30pm
* Try to schedule a demo / project share for 8pm.
* At the least: everyone says their name and what they accomplished that day. (Everyone accomplished something.)
* Reminder: Make sure they aren’t forgetting things!

#### Afterwards
* Follow up every week with at least one member that came on Slack. Ask them about their projects and if they might be interested in speaking at an event in the future! Talking to them will have a HUGE effect on them coming back.
* Also keep a note of the absolute best projects that you see - if we have a Lightning Talks meetup at some point, those are the people we would want to have speak!
