# event-organizing
resources, links, guidance for WWC Leads to help them plan amazing events.

If you're thinking of putting on an event with us for the first time, post to the all-leads channel on slack for support!

## Event Type
 Three main categories of event types
  * Recurring meetups - generally about 1-2 events per month with on average 10 - 50 people or less.
  * Special events - generally occur annually and aim for 50 - 200 people or more.
  * Leadership events - for education leads, directors, and other volunteers of the organization
  
## Scheduling
How often you organize a WWC event is completely up to you and your availability. Here we are sharing what we've all learned around logistics, timing, and and other concerns that can help you put on an fantastic event.

  * Organizing an event is a lot of work, if you have partners (shoot for at least 2!) it can really help you maintain the event.
  * Check the WWC DC Meetup calendar, in Meetup.com, for any conflicts before you hit publish.
  
### Recurring Events  
  * Even if you have a monthly meetup, the WWC DC guidance is you SHOULD NOT schedule auto-recurring events in Meetup.
  * Post new events at least 2 weeks before, and no more than one month before.
  
  
### Special Events


## Speakers

There's a couple ways you can find speakers for an event.
  * Ask the WWC slack or meetup attendees if they have any recommendations (all-leads and maybe a channel around your specific topic)
  * Check out We Speak Too http://wespeaktoo.org/cities/dc.html
  * Check out DC Tech Speakers (and add yourself while you're at it!) https://github.com/dctech/speaking

## Location and Sponsors

  * [Team Roster](https://github.com/womenwhocodedc/organization/blob/master/leadership-resources/our_leaders.md)  - lists who can help you find sponsors, location, and more

## Event Details
*Remember code of conduct

Any additional questions you can submit an issue request here or reach out on the all-leads channel on slack.
