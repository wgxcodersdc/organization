# Women and Gender eXpansive Coders DC Slack Guide  

---

## What is Slack?

Slack is a messaging application used by workplaces and organizations to facilitate communication and collaboration. An organization creates a team in Slack, which contains open channels (e.g., #javascript) or private groups (e.g., python-leads). You can also send private direct messages to other people and even small groups. 

Even though Slack has private groups and direct messages, you should try to use channels whenever possible instead to encourage information sharing and transparency. It may seem strange at first to talk in the open in channels, but you will eventually get used to it. You never know who on the team may know the answer and can help you out!

## Women and Gender eXpansive Coders DC + Slack

Women and Gender eXpansive Coders DC uses Slack to communicate in between events and study group sessions. Use Slack to ask other WGXCDC members technical questions, get advice on career issues, share learning resources, and broadcast events. 

Most of the messages and content you post in our Slack channels should relate to our mission of teaching and encouraging women and non-binary people to code. Popular topics include women in technology, learning how to code, technology career advice, and the DC Tech scene. If you are unsure about whether or not you should post something in Slack, feel free to reach out to any of the Women and Gender eXpansive Coders DC leads!

Spam, harassment, and messages and content that violate our code of conduct are not tolerated in the WGXCDC Slack. Individuals who violate our code of conduct will have their Slack accounts disabled. 

## Slack Usage Guidelines

- Avoid using @channel and instead use @here (_sparingly_), especially in large channels such as #_general and #_jobs.
- Mention other members by using @ and their username. Mentioning is good as the member may not have seen your message or follow up reply otherwise. _Be careful not to ping someone too often though - they may get annoyed with a large number of notifications!_
- Be careful with use of emojis that could cause headaches or seizures for some of our members.
- Do **not** ask the same question in 3-5 different channels. Try to ask the question in 1-2 of the most relevant or important channels.
- If a lengthy and specific conversation is targetting only 1-2 other participants and has no obvious benefit to the rest of the members in a public channel, _consider_ moving the conversation to a private Direct Message with the other parties.
- Understand that the participation of other members and leads in our group is _voluntary_ and an immediate response (or any response) should not always be expected.
- Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/wgxcodersdc/organization/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md) for additional guidance.

## Managing Notifications
- Don't feel like you need to read every single message on every Slack channel - just skim through what you find interesting
- You can set ping notifications for direct messages, mentions, or all messages for certain channels
- You can subscribe to have certain words highlighted - i.e. send me a Slack notification whenever someone says "Ruby on Rails" or "Wordpress"
- You can configure different notification settings for your laptop vs your phone
