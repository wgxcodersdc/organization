# Code of Conduct

For _Slack_, if a member is reported to have violated our policy or their behavior has created a toxic or hostile environment for the rest of the members in the group, then the following actions are a guideline as to how to handle the situation : 
1. On first offense, a warning will be issued and a dialogue will ensue with one of the leads and/or a director as to the specific behavior that caused the warning.
2. On second offense, the member's account will be temporarily suspended for a determined amount of time. The member will be notified about the suspension and the reasons why it was enacted in an email.
3. On third offense, the member will be permanently banned.

_NOTE: Based on the severity of the violation, the execution of the actions in these guidelines can be circumvented. If the behavior is so severe that it deems an immediate ban, then it is at the discretion of the leadership team to do so._

## Making a Report

If you see or experience someone violating this code of conduct and would like support from the leadership, you can contact any member of our leadership in person or electronically. Leads will keep these conversations private and take action only with consent of the affected member. You may report this by direct messaging a lead on slack or twitter (list of leads can be found [here](https://github.com/wgxcodersdc/organization/blob/master/leadership-resources/our_leaders.md)) or you can send an email to organizers at wgxcoders dot org.

When making a report, the following information is useful, but not required:

- Who violated the Code of Conduct?
- Where and when did the violation occurred?
- What happened?
- Who may have witnessed the violation?
- Who are you?


The Leadership Team will make every effort to remain impartial in dealing with Code of Conduct issues. If, for some reason, a lead or director can't accept the responsibility of enfocing a Code of Conduct issue, it will be dealt with by other leads or directors until the issue is resolved.

Please make contributions to this document or raise issues if you feel you have something to add.
