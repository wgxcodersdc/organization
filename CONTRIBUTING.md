# How to Contribute to This Repository

## Fork & Clone First
_note:_ If you have write permissions to this repo, no need to fork to your own GitHub account if you haven't already. Just clone this repository directly.

## Branch Second
**The Best Way:** 
  1.  On your local version of this repository, make a branch that's named something relevant to what you are doing (ex: `add-contributing-doc`).
  2.  Add and/or change files as needed. As most of these are going to be markdown (`.md`) files, there are some helpful resources about markdown syntax [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), and [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
  3.  Commit your changes with a meaningful message that relates to what you did or what the code will do (ex: `"Add contributing documentation"` or `"Add links to my presentation"`)
  4.  Push your branch up to your fork of this repository (if you don't have write access)
  5.  Open up a pull request and tag one of the [directors](https://github.com/wgxcodersdc/organization/blob/master/leadership-resources/our_leaders.md#directors) to review it.
  6.  They can merge your pull request into `master` and then delete the branch
  
If you are comfortable working on GitHub you can do the same process online (inluding branching and pull requests), but it's better to work on good git and GitHub habits by doing it locally and then pushing it up.

## Adding Links to Presentations

There are a number of sites that will host your presentations for free, including [Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/), [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/?ss), and Google Drive.  You can either choose to make your file public or only available to those with the link, but then paste the link into the relevant file in this repository. At this point there isn't a specific location, but please try to keep things organized. Depending on what the community thinks, in the future they might go as links in a `presentations.md` file or something similar, be linked to in resources, be linked to in separate relevant files, or some other way. This document will be changed when a decision is made to that regard.

## Adding Documents, Images, or Handouts

These can usually be shared in the same way as presentations: in a file storage service and then shared via link.  If you think that this is something that needs wider discussion, please open an issue on this repository for discussion.
