#Women Who Code DC

>Women Who Code (WWCode) is a global non-profit organization which inspires women to excel in careers in technology. We believe that innovation is driven by diversity and that the tech industry will be even better once women are no longer underrepresented. Women Who Code was founded in 2011 and has since grown to 25,000 members spanning 16 countries. The organization is best known for its technical study groups, hack nights, career development, and speaking events featuring influential technology industry experts and investors. Since inception, WWCode has produced more than 1000 events worldwide and garnered sponsorship from organizations like KPCB, Paypal, Etsy, Heroku, Yelp, and many others.

Welcome to Women Who Code DC's GitHub!  We have several folders for us to list resources, guides, open source projects we are working on, or anything that might be useful for the DC network.
