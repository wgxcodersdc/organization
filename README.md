# Women and Gender eXpansive Coders DC

Women and Gender eXpansive Coders DC envisions a community where women and non-binary members feel empowered to express their learnings, share their experiences, and feel safe in bringing their unique visions to events. We seek to foster growth in technical skills, career opportunities, and friendship through virtual and in-person meetings. All people are welcome to attend our events and support our members as they grow in their technology careers.

Welcome to Women and Gender eXpansive Coders DC's GitHub!  We have several folders for us to list resources, guides, open source projects we are working on, or anything that might be useful for the DC network.
