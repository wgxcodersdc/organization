# Women Who Code DC Ruby on Rails Resources

### Suggested Learning Tools

You will get the most out of our meetups if you follow one of our suggested resources. These are the classes/books/resources that our members know the best and can offer the most support for.

We will not assist with work problems. We are here to help you learn the skills that will help you solve work problems, but asking about work related problems derails the productivity of everyone at the event. Repeated requests for solutions to work problems will result in our leaders asking you to leave.

**CS Beginner**

If you want a great introdution to Computer Science and what programming is watch:
https://courses.edx.org/courses/HarvardX/CS50x3/2015/info - Harvard's CS50 Intro to CS class
(the first 3 weeks are essential but if you get into it...keep watching :) )

**Ruby Beginner**

* tryruby.org - Short Interactive, Intro to the Ruby Programming Language
* https://www.codeschool.com/paths/ruby - Take the Ruby Language Path to get a deeper introduction to the language

**For even more practice**

* http://rubykoans.com/ - Testing based approach to learning Ruby (I really like this guide because it teaches you test based development)
* http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ - Go through the exercises 

**Ruby Intermediate**

* https://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-for-zombies-redux - Rails for Zombies is a intro to the Ruby on Rails platform
* https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/soup-to-bits-rails-for-zombies - After doing Rails for Zombies watch this video to    understand how applications are built in Rails. I found this extremely helpful to translate the class above into practical   applications
* https://www.railstutorial.org/book - This is a pretty in-depth but excellent intro to building an app in Rails
* http://onemonthrails.com/ - This is a more visual, interactive version of the guide above but it costs money
